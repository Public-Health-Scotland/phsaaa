\title{Create backup and update new historical database of AAA screening KPIs, only runs if season is "autumn"}
\usage{
build_history(df_hist, df_new, kpi)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_hist}{Dataframe/tibble which contains historical data for relevant KPI.}

\item{df_new}{Dataframe/tibble containing new data for relevant KPI.}

\item{kpi}{KPI being added to the historical database, options are: "1.1-1.3", "1.4", "2", or "3"}
}
\value{
New historical dataframe/tibble updated for this analysis round.
}
\description{
Function requires multiple global environment variables to be specified:
'season' - either 'autumn' or 'spring'
'hist_path' - path to directory where historical files are to be stored
'kpi_report_years' - vector containing 3 character strings of financial years - third is the FY due to be published next
'fy_list' - list of financial years covering time since AAA screening started, in chronological order
'hb_list' - list of NHS Health Boards in alphabetical order
}
\examples{
# (example does not account for additional global environments required)

old <- dplyr::tibble(fin_year = c("2021/22", "2022/23"), kpi = "2.2", hbres = "Lothian", value = c(1,2))
new <- dplyr::tibble(fin_year = "2023/24", kpi = "2.2", hbres = "Lothian", value = 4)

new_hist_db <- build_history(old, new, "2")

print(new_hist_db)
