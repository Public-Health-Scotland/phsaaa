# build_history -----------------------------------------------------------

#' Create backup and update new historical database of AAA screening KPIs, only runs if 'season_var' is "autumn"
#'
#' Function requires multiple global environment variables to be specified:
#' 'season_var' - either 'autumn' or 'spring'
#' 'historical_path' - path to directory where historical files are to be stored
#' 'fys_in_report' - vector containing 3 character strings of financial years - third is the FY due to be published next
#' 'list_of_fys' - list of financial years covering time since AAA screening started, in chronological order
#' 'list_of_hbs' - list of NHS Health Boards in alphabetical order
#'
#' @param df_hist Dataframe/tibble which contains historical data for relevant KPI.
#' @param df_new Dataframe/tibble containing new data for relevant KPI.
#' @param kpi_number KPI being added to the historical database, options are: "1.1-1.3", "1.4", "2", or "3"
#' @param season_var Season of analysis, options are "Spring" or "Autumn"
#' @param fys_in_report Character vector, must be >= 3 length. Includes financial year being published, plus two prior.
#' @param list_of_fys Character vector of financial years in data, in chronological order
#' @param list_of_hbs Character vector of Health Board names, in alphabetic order
#' @param historical_path Filepath that points to the output directory - this is where previous historical data exists.
#'
#' @return New historical dataframe/tibble updated for this analysis round.
