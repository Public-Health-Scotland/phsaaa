#' Create backup and update new historical database of AAA screening KPIs, only runs if season is "autumn"
#'
#' Function requires multiple global environment variables to be specified:
#' 'season' - either 'autumn' or 'spring'
#' 'hist_path' - path to directory where historical files are to be stored
#' 'kpi_report_years' - vector containing 3 character strings of financial years - third is the FY due to be published next
#' 'fy_list' - list of financial years covering time since AAA screening started, in chronological order
#' 'hb_list' - list of NHS Health Boards in alphabetical order
#'
#' @param df_hist Dataframe/tibble which contains historical data for relevant KPI.
#' @param df_new Dataframe/tibble containing new data for relevant KPI.
#' @param kpi_number KPI being added to the historical database, options are: "1.1-1.3", "1.4", "2", or "3"
#'
#' @return New historical dataframe/tibble updated for this analysis round.
